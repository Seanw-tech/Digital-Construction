# BIM Clash Coordination Toolkit — Changelog

---

## v1.8 — 2026-06-20

### Platform
- Button renamed: "Additional Gate Rules" → "Updated Gate Rules"
- Header layout fixed: white-space:nowrap on btn-io and btn-theme; button row set to flex-wrap:nowrap — no more text wrapping
- Upload Matrix and Updated Gate Rules buttons moved from header to Revizto Clash Task Output card header in all four stage panels (T1–T4) — buttons now sit parallel to the checklist at stage level; hidden file inputs remain in DOM for JavaScript targeting
- A3 landscape layout: body/main/stage-panel now use full-height flex column chain (height:100vh, overflow:hidden); Gate Checklist and Clash Task table scroll within fixed-height panels; all chrome elements (card-header, toolbar, filter row, stats, signoff) set to flex-shrink:0; Rules tab and Run Log wrapped in scrollable containers; footer and nav also flex-shrink:0; page no longer grows vertically
- Updated Gate Rules upload now accepts the full AI response file (not just the extracted JSON block) — parser tries JSON.parse first, then searches for the `=== CLASH COORDINATION PLATFORM ===` delimiter, then falls back to first-`{`/last-`}` extraction; works with Claude, Copilot, and ChatGPT output formats

### Prompts
- `01_ProjectReport_ClashGate_Analysis.md` rewritten as v2.0: full Hub default reference (T1–T4, 58 items) embedded in prompt; AI compares extracted items against defaults and assigns RETAINED / SUPERSEDED / SUPPLEMENTED / NEW status; Part 1 output now includes Rule Status Summary table; JSON updated with `status` and `replacesDefault` fields; deprecated `overrides` and `customTasks` removed; discipline codes corrected to ARCH

---

## v1.7 — 2026-06-20

### Platform
- Dark / Light theme toggle added to header (🌙 Dark / ☀️ Light button) — preference persisted in localStorage
- Full dark theme CSS overrides implemented across all structural elements (header, nav, cards, tables, modals, forms, checklist, log)
- Rules tab dark overrides fixed: discipline-pair gap matrix, clearance breakdown chips, info box, service rules lists, project notes textarea
- Matrix cell colours now theme-aware (pastel for light, vivid for dark) via `getSTYLE()` function
- README updated to v1.6 (missed in previous push)

---

## v1.6 — 2026-06-20

### Platform
- Gate Sign-Off added to all four stage checklists (T1–T4): Services Coordinator signs off each gate before CSV export and clash detection can proceed
- Sign-off modal records name, role, date, and optional comment — persisted in localStorage and session export/import
- Sign-off badge appears in checklist card header once a stage is signed off
- CSV Export now shows a warning toast if the stage has not been signed off
- `revokeSignOff()` function allows sign-off to be corrected without losing checklist state
- Execution map revised: Services Coordinator (Step 2) signs off gate before BIM Coordinator (Step 3) runs clash detection
- **📋 Export for Review** button added to header — generates a formatted Excel file (one sheet per stage) with all gate checklist items pre-populated and a sign-off block at the bottom; intended for Services Coordinator offline review without needing to open the platform

### Prompts
- `01_ProjectReport_ClashGate_Analysis.md` updated: added full default checklist (T1–T4) as reference for AI to compare against before adding new items
- Added instruction to avoid duplicating existing default items and to flag outdated/superseded defaults
- Added "Checklist Review — Existing Default Items to Flag" table to PART 1 output

---

## v1.5 — 2026-06-20

### Workflow
- Added `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` — standing reference for the version-controlled update process; defines the 5-step protocol Claude follows before every push
- Rewrote `push_to_github.ps1` — single `$VERSION`/`$CHANGES` header at the top; all 6 files now share one consistent commit message; added pre-push file existence check and Y/N confirmation prompt; added links to live site and commit history on completion
- Updated Digital Construction `CLAUDE.md` — added Update Protocol section so Claude automatically follows the correct steps in every session
- Updated `README.md` — version bumped to 1.5, last-updated date corrected

---

## v1.4 — 2026-06-20

### Platform
- Pre-Clash Gate Checklist: added discipline filter dropdown (ARCH / STR / HYD / MEC / ELE / FIR / GEN) across all four stages
- Gate items from Claude/Copilot/ChatGPT JSON upload now inject directly as checkboxes into the correct stage checklist (highlighted with blue left border)
- Project gate items persist in localStorage and survive page reload and session export/import
- Removed clash task override processing from the Claude output upload — overrides must be made in the G05 matrix
- Toast messages updated to reflect gate item count only (no override count)

### Checklists (Framework Alignment)
- T4 cleaned: removed 4 misplaced items (firewall layout, fire rating of steel, grilles/louvres alignment, service penetration placeholders); T4 renumbered to 9 items
- T1: added T1-19 (STR — fire rating of steel through fire walls)
- T2: added T2-23 (ARCH — firewall layout verified against fire report)
- T3: added T3-20 (MEC — grilles aligned with louvres), T3-21 (MEC — service penetration placeholders)

### Colours & Tags
- HC clearance badge changed to red (`#7f1d1d / #fca5a5`)
- C600V clearance badge changed to green (`#064e3b / #6ee7b7`)
- All fire discipline tags standardised to `.disc-FIR` / `FIR` (red `#b91c1c`) — `.disc-FIRE` removed

### Prompts
- `01_ProjectReport_ClashGate_Analysis.md` updated: removed Clash Task Overrides and New Custom Clash Tasks sections; JSON schema simplified to `gateItems` + `procurementFlags` + `projectNotes`; prompt rewritten for cross-platform compatibility (Claude / Copilot / ChatGPT)

---

## v1.2 / v1.3 — 2026-06-19

### Platform
- Parsing helpers (`parseSheetRows`, `toCode`, `CLR_HV`, `catToStage`, `parseWorkbook`) extracted to top level — both upload and auto-load use identical logic
- HC and C600V colours updated throughout (CSS badges + gap matrix STYLE object + legend)
- `disc-FIRE` standardised to `disc-FIR` across platform HTML and all local copies

---
